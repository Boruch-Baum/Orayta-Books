# Orayta-Books

Books for the Orayta project.
All books are under free licenses. Mainly GPDL and Creative Commons.

# Installation

To install the books on a Linux system, go to the 'books' folder, and run:
 # ./GenMakeFile.sh
 # make install
 
All this does is copy the files to /usr/share/Orayta/Books, so you could always do that manually with:
 # cp -r -f ./ /usr/share/Orayta/
