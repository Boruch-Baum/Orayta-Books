Here are the 'source' files of the books for Orayta project. The compiled books should be in ../books .

If you edited a book, the best thing to do is run the UpdateBooks.sh script.
This should compile all modified books, copy them to ../books,  and update the booklist.

Note: This will not copy .folder files, so if you added a new folder, make sure to copy the .folder file your self.
